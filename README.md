I have tried to add JS but it doesn't work well. I think the error is about the link betwenn the different files.
CSS is almost ok, there is just a little mistake with the font.

I have some problem with my commit. I think it's because I haven't the habit to use "git log"

I know that my code could be better if I had commented so sorry.

I can't understand why my domain redirect on my README rather than my folder. =( i hope i could learn that soon with THP 

Thank's for reading.
